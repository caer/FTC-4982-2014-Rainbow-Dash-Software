FTC-4982-2014-Rainbow-Dash-Software
===================================

FIRST Tech Challenge Team #4982 Cafe Bot's software for their third and final robot of the 2014 Block Party season.  Please excuse the mess...

Rainbow Dash's program was split into two primary source files: RDA.c and RainbowDash.c.  
RDA.c handled the Autonomous segment of the challenge, while RainbowDash.c handled the Tele-Operated segment.  There are
numerous excess comments and typos strewn about the documentation which we are currently fixing now that the season is behind us.
